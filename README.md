# NestJS
This is a comprehensive course that will teach you how to build feature-complete applications using NestJS, a powerful and modern Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. From authentication and permissions systems to testing and code structuring, this course covers all the essential topics you need to become proficient in building robust and production-ready applications with NestJS.

## What You Will Learn
Deploying to Production: Learn how to deploy a complete application to production, including configuring environments, handling deployments, and managing dependencies.

Authentication and Permissions: Build authentication and permissions systems from scratch, including implementing authentication strategies, handling authorization, and managing user roles and permissions.

Testing: Learn how to write integration and unit tests for your NestJS applications to ensure your code is working as expected and catch potential issues early in the development process.

Data Validation: Automatically validate data included with incoming requests using NestJS built-in validation features, including handling request payloads, query parameters, and headers.

API Testing: Use an API client, such as Postman, to manually test your NestJS application and ensure it is functioning correctly.

Typescript and Code Structuring: Apply structure to your code using Typescript and learn how to organize your NestJS application for better maintainability and scalability.

Dependency Injection: Make your code more reusable and testable with dependency injection, a powerful feature of NestJS that allows for loose coupling and modularity in your application architecture.

TypeORM Relationships: Learn how to tie different types of data together using TypeORM relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

Behind-the-Scenes of NestJS: Gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of NestJS, including its decorators, modules, providers, and other key concepts that make it a powerful and extensible framework.

Guards: Use Guards in NestJS to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to sensitive data and protect your application against security vulnerabilities.

Request-Response Cycle: Understand NestJS's special request-response cycle and how it works behind the scenes to handle incoming requests and generate responses.

TypeORM Entities: Model your application's data using TypeORM entities, including defining entities, creating migrations, and performing CRUD operations on your data.
